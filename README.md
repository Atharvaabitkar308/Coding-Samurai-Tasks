ABOUT THE COMPANY 

At Coding Samurai, we strongly believe that practical knowledge is 
really important for doing well in the tech industry. Our main goal is 
to help students who might be missing some basic skills. We do this 
by giving them chances to learn in a hands-on way, where they work 
on real projects and see how things work in the real world. we know 
how valuable it is for future tech experts to actually try things 
themselves. That's why our internship program lets students learn by 
doing real projects. They get to work with experienced mentors who 
guide them along the way. Our team is made up of experts who have 
a lot of experience in the industry. They really care about helping 
interns learn and get better at what they do. We create a friendly and 
welcoming environment where everyone can learn, grow, and come 
up with new ideas 
 











 

 
 DATA SCIENCE 
DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP (TASK 1) 

Project Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Listings 

Project Description: In this project, you will perform basic data analysis on a dataset of 
Airbnb listings. EDA is a fundamental step in data science that involves exploring and 
understanding the data before diving into more complex analysis or modeling.

Steps you can Implement: 
Data Collection: Find a dataset of Airbnb listings in a city of your choice. You can often 
find such datasets on websites like Kaggle, Inside Airbnb, or by using Airbnb's official 
API (if available).

Data Exploration: Load and examine the dataset to get a sense of its structure. Look at 
the first few rows, data types, and basic statistics.

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and clean the data. This may involve filling 
missing values, removing duplicates, or correcting data inconsistencies.

Basic Statistics: Calculate and visualize basic statistics like the average price of listings, 
the distribution of property types (e.g., apartments, houses, etc.), and the distribution of 
neighborhoods.

Visualization: Create visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to explore 
relationships and trends in the data. For example, you can plot price distributions, room 
type preferences, or the number of listings by neighborhood.

Geospatial Analysis (Optional): If your dataset includes geographic information, you 
can perform simple geospatial analysis. Create maps to visualize the distribution of 
Airbnb listings across different neighborhoods or areas.

Time Series Analysis (Optional): If your dataset includes a date field, you can analyze 
how the number of listings or prices change over time. You can create time series plots 
and explore seasonality trends.

Correlation Analysis: Investigate correlations between different features. For instance, 
you can check if the number of bedrooms is correlated with the price or if the reviews 
affect the booking rates.

Data Insights: Summarize your findings and provide insights from your analysis. What 
interesting patterns or trends did you discover? What neighborhoods seem to be the 
most popular, and what factors might influence listing prices?

Documentation: Document your project, including the data source, steps you took, and 
the insights you gained. This documentation will be useful for presenting your findings 
and referring back to your work.

DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP (TASK 2)

Project Title: Predicting House Prices 

Project Description: Build a simple machine learning model to predict house prices 
based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, neighborhood, 
and more. This project will introduce you to regression analysis, which is a fundamental 
concept in data science.

Steps you can Implement: 
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset of house prices. You can find real estate datasets on 
websites like Kaggle, Zillow, or government housing agencies.

Data Exploration: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, check for missing 
values, and gain insights into the distribution of house prices and features.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and 
converting categorical variables into numerical format (e.g., one-hot encoding for 
neighborhoods).

Feature Selection: Choose relevant features that you believe may have an impact on 
house prices. You can use correlation matrices or feature importance techniques for 
guidance.

Model Selection: Select a regression algorithm such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree 
Regression, or Random Forest Regression for this project.

Data Split: Split your dataset into a training set and a testing set. Typically, 80% of the 
data is used for training and 20% for testing.

Model Training: Train your chosen regression model on the training data, using the 
selected features as input and house prices as the target variable.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using metrics 
like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared 
Error (RMSE).

Prediction: Use your trained model to make house price predictions for new data 
points or hypothetical scenarios.

Visualization: Create visualizations, such as scatter plots or regression plots, to visualize 
the relationships between individual features and house prices.

Model Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters of the regression model to 
see if you can improve its predictive accuracy.

Documentation: Document your project, including the dataset source, preprocessing 
steps, model selection, and evaluation results. This documentation will help you 
communicate your findings and methods effectively.
